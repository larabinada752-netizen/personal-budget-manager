 Author

I worked on this project with a lot of ‚ù§Ô∏è and dedication.
It took me some time to build and polish the code, and I also shared it with my university professor as part of my studies.
The code was originally on my computer, and now I‚Äôm uploading it here to GitHub to share it publicly and keep it safe online.
